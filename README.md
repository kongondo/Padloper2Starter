# Padloper 2 Starter Site - DEMO 1

## Preamble

Please read the `README` in the [main branch](https://github.com/kongondo/Padloper2Starter) before using `Demo 1`. Ensure you read about the requirements and instructions.

## Demo

This is the Padloper **Demo 1**. It is the demo that powers the [Padloper demo](https://demo.kongondo.com/) site.

It is a complete demonstration of a Padloper shop frontend including products and categories/collections display, single product display, add products to checkout and checkout process. It utilises htmx and alpine.js in various places including checkout. It uses an ajax-powered checkout via htmx. This means ajax responses are html.
