# Padloper 2 Starter Site - DEMO 2

## Preamble

Please read the `README` in the [main branch](https://github.com/kongondo/Padloper2Starter) before using `Demo 2`. Ensure you read about the requirements and instructions.

## Introduction

This is the Padloper **Demo 2**. The main difference between this and [Demo 1](https://github.com/kongondo/Padloper2Starter/tree/demo-1) is that `Demo 2` shows how you can add inputs for and collect and process extra information from customers during checkout. Specifically, how to allow customers to customise their ordered products at checkout and subsequently view the requests in your Padloper backend.
