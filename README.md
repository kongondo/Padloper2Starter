# Padloper 2 Starter Site - DEMO 5

## Preamble

Please read the `README` in the [main branch](https://github.com/kongondo/Padloper2Starter) before using `Demo 5`. Ensure you read about the requirements and instructions.

## Demo

This is the Padloper **Demo 5**. The main difference between this and [Demo 1](https://github.com/kongondo/Padloper2Starter/tree/demo-1) is that `Demo 5` shows how you can have a checkout form with only a minimum number of inputs. In Demo 5, only email and country inputs are required.

Please note that this demo requires that you use a custom checkout form (as per its files) instead of the Padloper inbuilt one. This will give you the flexibility to amend inputs to the form.

## Layout

Note that the underlying layout files for `Demo 5` differ slightly from those of `Demo 1`. In `Demo 5`, the checkout `form` spans across the whole grid layout to encompass the `order summary` column on the right. This is in order to include any inputs that you might wish to include in that grid column.
